  <ol>
    <li>Clean and wash the toor dal well. Add washed and strained dal in pressure cooker along with 2 cups of water and pressure cook until done. Once dal is done, mash it and set it aside.</li>
    <li>In another pot, heat oil. Add mustard seeds and fenugreek seeds fry until just aromatic. Ensure not to burn the seeds.</li>
    <li>Add curry leaves and dried red chillies and fry for few seconds. Then, add hing (asafoetida) and mix.</li>
    <li>Add sambar onions (pearl onions/shallots) and sauté on high for a minute or 2 until soft.</li>
    <li>Add all the vegetables ( brinjal, radish, pumpkin, drumsticks) and mix. Sauté on high for a minute. Add chopped tomatoes and sauté on high for another 2-3minutes.</li>
    <li>Add turmeric powder, red chilli powder, sambar powder and mix. Sauté on medium heat for a minute. Take care not to burn the masalas.</li>
    <li>Add boiled and mashed dal and salt, mix . Add tamarind pulp, chopped coriander leaves and water. The amount of water depends upon the consistency of sambar you need.</li>
    <li>Mix everything and simmer until vegetables are cooked through but intact. I simmer it for good 8-10 minutes to bring out the flavours to the fullest.</li>
    <li>Dish out and serve hot sambar with steaming hot idli or vada or steamed rice.</li>
